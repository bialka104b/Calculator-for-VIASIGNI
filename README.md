### After entering the values in running meters into the input, the calculator multiplies this by the number of square meters of a given sign and gives us the result of the area painted in square meters.

### Additionally, the value of each character is displayed in textarea so that you can copy it.

### At the very end the calculator adds up the whole painted area of all the characters.
